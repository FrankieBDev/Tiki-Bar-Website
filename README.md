# Tiki Bar Website
 A made up bar somewhere hot and tropical!
 
 For this project I was very keen to learn how to create a picture carousel as I think they are quite effective on this style of website and I've not made one yet! 
 So far I have a carousel that technically works, using Bootstrap but it's quite clunky and needs some work to look smooth and professional.
 
 I also made a nav bar with alot more ease than my last project so winning!
> hover colour needs changing & drop down
 
 >Work still do to on:
 info boxes
 footer
 othet pages!
